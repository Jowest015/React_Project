# React-Project (Weather App)

## Set-up

Weather app will display city name, current weather(Icons?), temperature, humidity and wind speed...for the kite flyers.

- [x] Get react app up
- [x] Set-up react router
- [ ] Code in the basic functions of app (use hard coded attributes at the first)
- [ ] Hook-up weather API(flex-goal...although very important)

May not need to use react-redux; so I need another 3rd party react component to meet project requirements.

### Get React App Installed
- [x] 'nough said and done

### Set-up React-router
`npm i react-router-dom`

App will use 2 main pages: 
- [x] The Dashboard which will include 5-day forecast
- [x] Today's weather close-up; click on current day card to see the hourly forecast.
- [x] Optional: current weather page; a constantly updating view of current weather.

### Code in Basic Functions
- [ ] create hard-coded data to example functionality
- [ ] dashboard page will have 5 'cards with forecast information
- [ ] close-up page will have morning, evening and night forecast or possibly hourly (might be a flex goal)
- [ ] current page will show updated forecast(every 5 minutes) throughtout the day
- [ ] style the cards on each page
