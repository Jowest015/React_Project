# React-Project (Weather App)

## Set-up

Weather app will display city name, current weather(Icons?), temperature, humidity and wind speed...for the kite flyers.

- [x] Get react app up
- [x] Set-up react router
- [ ] Code in the basic functions of app (use hard coded attributes at the first)
- [ ] Hook-up weather API

May not need to use react-redux; so I need another 3rd party react component to meet project requirements.

### Get React App Installed
'nough said and done

### Set-up React-router
`npm i react-router`

App will use 2 main pages: 
- [ ] The Dashboard which will include 5-day forecast
- [ ] Today's weather close-up; click on current day card to see the hourly forecast.
- [ ] Optional: current weather page; a constantly updating view of current weather.
